# Ashes Issue
This repo is for reporting issues for the [Ashes configurator](https://www.ergokb.tw/ashes/).

The Ashes is using [WebUSB] API to transfer data, and can be supported with the modified [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). We are planning to support other keyboards in the future.

If you found any bug or improvment, please open an issue in this repo.
